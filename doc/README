from http://frugal.sourceforge.net/) in order to save hard-drive space by 
installing only those packages of Python(x,y) that are required to run Frugal.

  http://www.pythonxy.com
 1. Start xyweb and choose Full Edition, then click Download (about 400MB)
 2. Click Yes when asked if the installer should start
 3. In the "Choose Components" window, select Minimum as the "type of install" 
    and then expand the "Python" branch in the "optional components window" 
    and select components "wxPython", "NumPy" and "Matplotlib" (package 
    "Nose" will be automatically selected when "NumPy" in selected)
